Consider a situation where you're building a website that lets users search for their favorite movies, and you use OMDB as your data source. Imagine that it takes 500ms for OMDB to respond to a request at that particular URL. When OMDB starts receiving a large number of requests at that URL, the server will start to slow down as it has to process each and every request. As more requests come in, responses start taking 600ms... 700ms.. 800ms.. to respond, until eventually they start timing out.

A common optimization for this scenario is to introduce a "cache server" between the client (a jQuery website in this example) and the destination server (OMDB in this example). A cache allows you and your code to store a copy of frequently accessed data in some form of data structure for quick access when needed. In this example, the cache would be an Express server that sits between the website and OMDB. Adding a cache to a server could allow a single server to handle hundred of times more requests than one without a cache.

In this exercise, we're going to use the Express framework to build a server that can talk to another server and cache the results. Your web server will respond to GET requests for http://localhost:3000/ and return the data from the OMDb API. However, when making a second request to the same endpoint http://localhost:3000/?i=tt3896198, the server should not return data from the OMDB API, but instead from some object or array.
